            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Computer Science Undergraduate Council (CSUG) is a student organization that aims to build a community for computer science majors and those interested in the field. CSUG helps bring students together and offers resources such as career
                information and tutoring.</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>To create marketing material to attract students to join CSUG.</p>

            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                Students that have recently changed to Computer Science or underclassmen that have entered as Computer Science Majors.
            </p>

            <h3>Roles & Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>
                As the Social Media Chair, I am responsible for designing promotional material and creating posters for events, as well as managing our social media accounts.

        <p>
            To begin, I analyzed past Instagram posts to identify ways to improve CSUG's online presence. I noticed that there was a clear color scheme based on the organization's logo and that the feed had a vibrant, slightly disorienting appearance. With this in
            mind, I sought to find ways to enhance the visual appeal and clarity of our social media content.

        <h1>Brand Design v1</h1>

            <figcaption>Kimbie Dark Theme VSCode</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            In order to create a sense of belonging and make our social media content accessible to new members, I sought to draw inspiration from elements of computer science that would be familiar to anyone interested in the field. I looked to common themes in
            integrated development environments (IDEs) that would be visually appealing. As a starting point, I experimented with using a color palette and text format similar to the Kimbie Dark Theme in Visual Studio Code.

        </figure>
        <p>However, after comparing this new design to past posts, there was visually no connection to our previous content, which I concluded would only make our feed more disorienting. I searched for other design options.</p>

            <figcaption>Palette Inspiration</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            After looking through other IDE themes for inspiration, along with references to our current logo, I settled on this bright, cool toned palette, with an emphasis on a sunny, light, lemon color. I thought it would give our brand a new, refreshed feel without
            seeming too distant from our past designs.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            I gathered design elements to use consistently in a design template. This included selecting modern, sans serif fonts that would give off an approachable but professional vibe. I also created computer science-themed elements such as web pages to add visual
            interest to our posters and other promotional materials.
