            Hello! My name is Emily and I am currently a student at the University of Rochester, where I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Digital Media Studies, as well as an HCI Certificate. I became interested in UX design, specifically in the
            realm of websites and mobile applications, after taking courses in web development during the summer of 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always been passionate in design and creating things that can improve people's lives. When I was younger, I used to enjoy making posters on all sorts of random topics, and I loved the whole process- from researching the topic to designing the poster.
            UX design is a lot like that and more, which is why I am excited to pursue it as a career.
        </p>
